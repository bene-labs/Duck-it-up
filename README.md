# Duck it up!
Fight for bread and quack for glory!
## Core Gameplay Mechanics
### Collecting Bread:
Ducks move around a small park area to eat pieces of bread.
Each piece of bread increases the duck's size slightly.

### Bumping Mechanic:
Ducks can bump into each other. Larger ducks have a stronger bump force.
Simple physics-based interactions for bumps.

### Objective:
Eat more bread than the opponent within a 3-minute time limit.

### Controls:
Tank controls -> One button to turn left, one to turn right and then a break and accelerate button.
Controls are slippery by design making it hard to turn in time to increase the challenge of collectiong bread.
